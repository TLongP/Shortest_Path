# Requirements
- Numpy
- PyQt5

# Shortest_Path
To use this program just start main.py
Then you can draw the obstacles and then go to edit and start the program.

I want to say that if no path exists, then this will throw an error and stop the program. So I will fix this in the future. Secondly, I used only 1 algorithm, so I will add some new algorithm.

Feel free to use this code.
